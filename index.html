                            A client that specialised in surveying of Railway lines required a software control system to connect a number of different sensors (such as GPS, cameras and 3D radar). The software was primarily for the collection, organisation and management of the data related to the location along a particular length of track it was gathered, this data was then uploaded to global server.
                            <br /><br />
                            My involvement in this project was the implementation of the user interface for this system, which for the purposes of displaying on multiple screens was done using web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript connecting to a server using Signal-R websockets. Although the higher level wireframes were not designed by me, I choose all the details of the Software design and choose to use Object oriented JS, Jquery UI and a custom theme, along with Kendo UI for the plotting of Charts.

                        <h1>IMS Alumni Drupal Site</h1>
                        <p>
                            Another client in the Healthcare Industry wanted to created a website that would keep track of former employees and the sharing of exclusive content. It was decided that the website would be implemented using the Drupal Content Management System which would include such features as ability to make content and members searchable and for Administrators to easily upload and manage content to be displayed.
                            <br /><br />
                            My Involvement with the project was to implement the design using a Drupal style theme that was created using a third party designer, although eventually all modifications of styles where done by myself. I had to administer and develop the Drupal site, this was done using a number of custom modules as well as modifying Drupal templates which required an understanding of PHP and the Drupal API. The website was successfully deployed and the client later asked for a more sophisticated archiving system to be added based on the quality of the initial work.

                            My novel idea for an on-line forum that took inspiration from mind mapping software, each comment by a user is a speech bubble with replies to the comment linked by arrows. It is possible to expand/minimise the to each comment which is more clearly displayed than a traditional forum where the screen can become cluttered to show this same thing. My Supervisor liked the idea and thought that it would be a good addition to his Social Science cross disciplinary research group and on the strength of my work I was offered an RA position.
                            <br /><br />
                            The application used JS and AJAX to update from a server running PHP and MySQL database. The application allowed the user to log in with Facebook so I had some exposure to the Facebook Javascript and PHP API.
